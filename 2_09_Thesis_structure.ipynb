        "Spin coating is used to apply photoresist to the samples. The sample is fixed to a round holder using vacuum. A thin film of photoreist (Exxx, Exxx) is applied using a syringe. The chamber is closed and the sample is spun fast (2000 10 sec 4000 10 sec) **ask anna**. This creates a uniform coating of the photoresit. The thickness of the photoresist is dependent on RPM and the intrinsic properties of the photoresist.  \n",

        "#### Prebaking \n",
        "\n",
        "After covering the sample with photoresit, a drying sample is used to improve adhesion and remove solvent from the photoresit. The Baking removes the casting solvent from teh film, creating a solid state that prevents mixig of the exposed area with the unexposed area. This increases the definition of the pattern on the sample. **For my samples the table is reported later**\n",

        "The photomask is a square galss plate with a patterned metal film on one side. \n",
        "To pass on the photomask patter to the sample it first needs to be alligned. The photomask has small marks on each corner. The first exposure doesn't need any allignemtn, and creates the allignemtn marks. Subsequent allignemts can be achieved by alligning the allignemnt marks in the xy plane. \n",
        "In this project the **Karl-Suss MA6** mask aligner was used. \n",

        "\n",
        "#### Exposure \n",
        "\n",
        "Once the substrate is alligned, it is necessary to expose the substrate to UV radiation to imprint the pattern on the photoresist. The exposure can be done in **proximity** or in **contact** mode. Contact mode presents the best resolution. Contact mode hower incrases the risk of damaging the mask, making it less used in production. \n",
        "The UV is produced with a mercury lamp. The lamp radiates the sample uniformly through the mask. The light spectrum emmited by the mercury lamp has an emission spectra resonant to that of the photoresit that absorsbes it. The exposed photoresist's chemical properties change marking a difference between the exposed and unexposed photoresit. Since the photoresit is sensitive to light, the light used in the room needs to be filtered. In CEMOP clean room yellow light is used. \n",

        "Developper is used to removed the exposed (positive) photoresit or unexposed (negative) photoresit photoresist. The exposed sample is dipped into the developper and hte basin is moved from side to side until all the exposed photoresist is removed. The sample is then washed in water to remmoved the developper. The sample now has a layer of patterned photoresit. \n",

        "Now that the sample has been lithographycally patterned, the exposed material needs to be removed. Etching can be divided into two classes: \n",

        "##### Wet etching\n",
        "Wet etching uses highly selective chemicals to removed the exposed material. The chemicals don't attack the photoresis. Wet etching removes the exposed material in all directions. This means that when it is in contact with the material below the photoresist, it will etch it. This process is call Isotropic Etching. The main advantage of wet etching is the low prices. \n",

        "\n",
        "In dry etching plasma or etchant gases remove the substrate material. This is accomplish by 3 processes:  physical dry etching,  chemical dry etching and reactive ion etching (RIE).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Phisical dry etching: the kinetic energy of the incoming ions is used to physically knock off the atoms on the substrate. This process is highly anisotropic. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Chemical dry etching is similar to wet etching, a chemical reaction removes atoms from the substrate. This process is isotropic. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Reactive ion etching (RIE) is a combination of physical and chemical. Plasma is used to ionize reactive gases. The ions are then accelerated towards the surcface. Etching occurs by both chemical reaction and kinetic energy transfer. RIE offers high selectivity and good anisotropy. \n",
        "\n",
        "Dry etching offers many advantages. RIE is both selective and anisotropic, removed the undercutting problem. RIE also offers high control of Z depth etching (nm precision). \n",
        "\n",
        "In this work the **TRION PHANTOM III RIE** gas was used to dry etched. For all Gate-dielectirc-sourcedrain SF6 gas was used. Since the gas would react with both the Gate and the dielectric, when etcthing the dielectric one had to be very careful not to overetch and attack the Mo of the Gate. \n",
